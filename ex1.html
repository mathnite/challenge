<br>Keep in mind:<br>
Max Health = Health + Shield<br>
Health can be from 1 - 100<br>
Shield can be from 0 - 100<br>
Mini Shield gives you +25 Shield until you are at 50 Shield. <br>
Big Shield gives you  +50 up to 100 Shield<br>
AR (assault rifle) deals 33 damage<br>
A Purple Shotgun deals 30 - 200 damage (in this scenario 110 damage)<br>
A Gold Rocket deals 130 damage<br>
A Cracked shield means you have 0 Shield remaining<br>

Your max health is 200. A Mini Shield gives 25 Shield, but only up to 50<br>
Shield, meaning no matter what Shield level a player starts at, the player<br>
can only gain up to 50 Shield by popping a Mini Shield. So the least possible<br>
Max Health the player can have in this situation is 26 Max Health<br>
(1 Health + 0 Shield + 25 Shield from the mini = 26 Max Health), and the most<br>
possible Max Health the player can have is 150 (100 Health + 25-49 Shield +<br>
25 shield from the mini = 150 Max Health).

You take the answers from the previous question and subtract the amount of<br>
damage the pump shotgun does. In this scenario, the pump shotgun does 110 damage.<br>
Because they are still alive, we know they had more than 110 health, so the new<br>
possible minimum Max Health they have is 1. (This would mean they had at least 111<br>
health previously). The Max Health they could now have is 40 (150 - 110 = 40).

If an AR (assault rifle) does 33 damage at minimum, and they are between 1<br>
and 40 health, they can possibly be downed with one shot, and a guaranteed<br>
down with 2 shots. This is because 40 - 33 = 7, so they might survive the first<br>
shot if they have Max Health 40. But if you hit them a second time, they will<br>
certainly die because 7 - 33 < 0.
