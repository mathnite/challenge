# challenge

When we heard about the contest, we thought about video games, and how math can improve your gameplay. We figured that kids who enjoy video games would be more willing to learn math if they saw how math can be used in popular games like Fortnite.

Math can sound foreign to kids, the same way video games can sound foreign to adults. So we will walk through how math could help during a Fortnite game. In a game, if your enemy has good mechanics, you can still defeat them if you can quickly calculate their approximate health. Key moments in gameplay give you clues about a player’s health, and if you can track their health through the fight, you can figure out what it likely takes to defeat them. This can impact whether you attack or run, what weapons you use, or how many times you’ll have to hit them to win. If you are playing with friends, you can also use this knowledge to troll them with a pick axe kill, one of the most embarrassing ways to go out. In this site, we detail some specific situations to show kids how they can use quick math to decide their next moves. 

When kids find out math can help them in games, they will have a reason to learn math and not feel like they are being forced to learn. Games like this may not help for higher levels of math, but if you are using quick addition and multiplying during your gameplay, your speed and familiarity with math will improve, which will allow you to do more complicated math problems in the future. This site shows how math is everywhere in the world and how it is used in so many situations. 

We are hosting this prototype on github because it is easy to host hand-built website made from html, css, and javascript. It also makes it easy to use bootstrap as a framework, and we learned a little bit about how Jekyll uses templates to make coding sites easier.

In ordeer to make the site fun and feel like playing a game, we mixed together images, videos, and code that we found in various places on the web, combining and transforming them into our project.
