<br>Keep in mind:<br>
Max Health = Health + Shield<br>
Health can be from 1 - 100<br>
Shield can be from 0 - 100<br>
Mini Shield gives you +25 Shield until you are at 50 Shield. <br>
Big Shield gives you  +50 up to 100 Shield<br>
AR (assault rifle) deals 33 damage<br>
A Purple Shotgun deals 30 - 200 damage (in this scenario 110 damage)<br>
A Gold Rocket deals 130 damage<br>
A Cracked shield means you have 0 Shield remaining<br>

You can hear when someone’s shield gets broken (or “cracked”), and this means<br>
they now have no shield, and Max Health of 100 or less. We can make good estimates<br>
of how much health they have left based on knowing common increments for shield.<br>
Shields are commonly gained in increments of 25 or 50 (25 using Mini Shields, up to<br>
50 Shield, and 50 using Big Shields up to 100 Shield). While it’s possible, people<br>
rarely have 175 Max Health, because Mini Shields are usually popped in pairs<br>
(25 + 25 = 50), because you can’t use Mini Shields to exceed 150 Max Health. This<br>
means if you break your opponent’s Shield with a shot that does 80 damage, they<br>
most likely started at 150 Max Health, and are now most likely at 70 Max Health.<br>
They could not have started at 200 Max Health, because 80 would not have cracked<br>
the shield (200 - 80 = 120, means they still have at least 20 Shield) There is a<br>
small possibility they were at 175 Max Health, and now are at 95 Max Health.

If the player has guaranteed less than 100 health, and they are hit for 45,<br>
then they now have less than 55 health (<100 Health - 45 Health = <55 Health).<br>
If you think they have 70 health, which is most likely, and they are hit for 45,<br>
then they probably now have 25 health ( 70 Health - 45 Health = 25 Health).<br>

If an AR (assault rifle) does 33 damage to the body and they are most likely at<br>
 25 health, he can take the player out with one shot (25 - 33 < 0) The most health<br>
 they can be is 55, in which case he could take them out with 2 shots (55 - 33 - 33 < 0).
